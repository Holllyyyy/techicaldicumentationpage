         <header><h2>Java Script and Java</h2></header><p>In this article, we will know about Java & Javascript, & also see the significant 
             distinction between Java & Javascript.

            JavaScript:
            JavaScript is a lightweight programming language(“scripting language”) and is used to make web pages interactive. 
            It can insert dynamic text into HTML. JavaScript is also known as the browsers language. JavaScript(JS)
             is not similar or related to Java. Both the languages have a C-like syntax and are widely used in client-side and
              server-side Web applications, but there are few similarities only.</p>
              <h3>Features of Javascript:</h3>
              <ul class="list">
                  <li>JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. 
                      Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.</li>
                      <li>
                        Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object. They can be passed as arguments in other functions.
                      </li>
                      <li>Can handle date and time.</li>
                      <li>Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.</li>
                      <li>No compiler is needed.</li>
              </ul>

         <pre>
            <code class="cod"><textarea disabled><script>
                console.log("HelloWorld");
            </script></textarea></code></pre>
<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Java is an object-oriented programming language and has a virtual machine platform that allows you to create compiled programs that run on nearly every platform. Java promised, “Write Once, Run Anywhere”.</p>

    Features of Java:
    
    <p>Platform Independent: Compiler converts source code to bytecode and then the JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler. This bytecode can run on any platform.
    Object-Oriented Programming Language:  Organizing the program in the terms of collection of objects is a way of object-oriented programming, each of which represents an instance of the class. There are 4 pillars of OOP’s concept:</p>
    <ul class="list"><li>Abstraction</li>
    <li>Encapsulation</li>
    <li>Inheritance</li>
    <li>Polymorphism</li></ul>
    <ul class="list"><li>
    Simple: Java is one of the simple languages as it does not have complex features like pointers, 
    operator overloading, multiple inheritances, Explicit memory allocation.</li>
    <li>Robust: Java language is robust that means reliable. It is developed in such a way that it puts a lot of 
        effort into checking errors as early as possible, that is why the java compiler is able to detect even those errors that are 
        not easy to detect by another programming language.</li>
    <li>Secure: In java, we don’t have pointers, and so we cannot access out-of-bound arrays i.e it shows ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception if
         we try to do so.</li>
    <li>Distributed:  We can create distributed applications using the java programming language. 
        Remote Method Invocation and Enterprise Java Beans are used for creating distributed applications in java.</li>
    <li> Java supports multithreading. It is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum
         utilization of CPU.</li></ul>
    Example: This is the basic Java program.
  <pre><code class="cod"><textarea disabled> java.io.*;
  
class mw {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println(
            "Welcome to my website");
    }
}</textarea></code></pre>

        <section id="HTML" class="main-section">
            <header><h2>HTML</h2></header>
            <p>HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.

                The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.
                </p>
            <h3>The History of HTML</h3>
                <p>HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
                
                Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.
                
                A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
             </p>
                <h3>What are Tags and Attributes?</h3>
                    Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.
                    
                    They work together but perform different functions '–' it is worth investing 2 minutes in differentiating the two.
                    
                   <h3> What Are HTML Tags?</h3>
                    Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: h1.
                    
                    Most tags must be opened h1 and closed h1 in order to function.
                    
                   <h3> What are HTML Attributes? </h3>
                    Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.
                    
                    <h3>An example of an attribute is:</h3>
                   <pre> <code class="cod"><textarea disabled> <img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog." > </textarea></code></pre>
                    
              
                  <h3>Golden Rules To Remember</h3>
                    The vast majority of tags must be opened <pre><code><textarea>(<tag>)</textarea></code></pre> and closed <pre><code><textarea>(</tag>)</textarea></code></pre> with the element information such as a title or text resting between the tags.
                    When using multiple tags, the tags must be closed in the order in which they were opened. For example:
                    
                   <pre><code class="cod"><textarea disabled><strong><em>This is really important!</em></strong></textarea> </code></pre>
                    
                    
                  
           
        </section>
        <section id="CSS" class="main-section">
            <header><h2>CSS</h2></header>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
                 markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
                 characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which 
                 reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed 
                 between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
                 for different rendering
                 methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
                  tactile devices. CSS also 
                 has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
                
                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches 
                a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
                
                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type)
                 text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS
                  documents.[5]
                
                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XU </p>
            <h3>Use</h3>
                <p>Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup.
                 All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, 
                 often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, 
                 resulting in considerably simpler HTML.
                
                For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2), sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally using HTML.
                 In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for these elements is presentational.
                
                Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had 
                to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more complex, larger,
                 and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color,
                  font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently
                   for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text readers. 
                   The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.</p>
                
                For example, under pre-CSS HTML, a heading element defined with red text would be written as:
                
                <pre><code class="cod"><textarea disabled><h1><font color="red">Chapter 1.</font></h1></textarea></code></pre>
                
                Using CSS, the same element can be coded using style properties instead of HTML presentational attributes:
                
                <pre><code class="cod"><textarea disabled><h1 style="color: red;">Chapter 1.</h1></textarea></code></pre>
                The advantages of this may not be immediately clear but the power of CSS becomes more apparent when the
                 style properties are placed in an internal style element or, even better, an external CSS file. For example, suppose the document 
                 contains the style element:
                
              <pre><code class="cod"><textarea disabled><style>
                    h1 {
                        color: red;
                    }
                </style></textarea></code></pre> 
                All h1 elements in the document will then automatically become red without requiring any explicit code.
                 If the author later wanted to make h1 elements blue instead, this could be done by changing the style element to:
                
                <pre><code class="cod"><textarea disabled><style>
                    h1 {
                        color: blue;
                    }
                </style></textarea></code></pre>
                rather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the color for each individual h1 element.
                
                The styles can also be placed in an external CSS file, as described below, and loaded using syntax similar to:
                
               <pre><code class="cod"><textarea disabled><link href="path/to/file.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"></textarea></code></pre> 
                This further decouples the styling from the HTML document and makes it possible to restyle multiple documents
                 by simply editing a shared external CSS file.

        <section id="Python" class="main-section">
            <header><h2>Python</h2></header>
            <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability 
                with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers 
                write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

                Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, 
                procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive
                 standard library.
                
                Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 
                as Python 0.9.0.[33] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a cycle-detecting garbage 
                collection system (in addition to reference counting). Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was
                 a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 
                 2020.</p>
            <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s[39] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as 
                a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[40] capable of exception handling and interfacing with
                 the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989.[41] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the 
                 project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as 
                 Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as
                  the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member "Steering Council"
                   to lead the project.</p>

               <p> Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector 
                (in addition to reference counting) for memory management and support for Unicode.
                
                Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.
                [46] Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[47] and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 
                2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.
                
                Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern 
                that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[49][50] No more security patches 
                or other improvements will be released for it.[51][52] With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x[53] and later are 
                supported.
                
                Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[54] as all versions of Python (including 2.7[55]) had security issues, leading to
                 possible remote code execution[56] and web cache poisoning.</p>

        <section id="Responsive_Web_Design" class="main-section"><header><h2>Responsive Web Design</h2></header>
        <p>Responsive web design (RWD) or responsive design is an approach to web design that aims to make web pages 
            render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size to ensure 
            usability and satisfaction.

            A responsive design adapts the web-page layout to the viewing environment[1] by using techniques such as fluid
             proportion-based grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries, an extension of
              the @media rule, in the following ways:</p>
            
            <ul class="list">
                <li>The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than absolute
             units like pixels or points.</li>

           <li>Flexible images are also sized in relative units, so as to prevent them from displaying outside their containing element.</li>

            <li>Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the device the site is being
                 displayed on, 
            e.g. width of the rendering surface (browser window width or a physical display size).</li>

            <li>Responsive layouts automatically adjust and adapt to any device screen size, whether it is a desktop, a laptop, a tablet,
             or a mobile phone.</li></ul>

           <p> Responsive web design became more important as users of mobile devices came to account for the majority of web site visitors.
             In 2015, for instance, Google announced Mobilegeddon and started to boost the page ranking of mobile-friendly sites when 
             searching from a mobile device.
            
            Responsive web design is an example of user interface plasticity.</p>
